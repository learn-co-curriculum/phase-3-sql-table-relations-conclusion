# Table Relations in SQL Conclusion

We've established that SQL is a useful programming language to know, and that
the majority of databases you'll work with will have more than one table. As
demonstrated in this section, we've been able to learn and apply concepts that
connect together these tables in various ways. These table relationships are
important to illustrate real-world data.

In this section we covered:

- The structure of a relational database as tables
- How to associate data tables using a foreign key column
- Different types of joins
- Relationship types, such as "one-to-many" and "many-to-many"

We can now distinguish the different types of relationships between data in a
database, and use SQL to query data across multiple tables.

With the ability to define relationships between different tables we can model
data that is more accurate to the real world!
